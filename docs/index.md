# Welcome to The Noc Cave

This is a brain dump style website for myself. As part of my role sites like this make my life easier so it is only fair I contribute back.

I appologise for the bad spelling, grammer and probably mostly out of date content (And from years of disabling SELinux as a first step. I am reformed I swear) However posts are generally done quickly, without a whole lot of extra thought, no proof reading or going back updating once they are done.

If you find an issue then please either raise and issue or submit a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/thenoccave/website)
